# 🏔️ Valley of Gods Project

This is a tourism website I created for Manali, India. It’s a multi-page project that covers everything a tourist would need—from "About" info to booking tours.

## 🎯 Project Goals
* Create a website that looks professional and trustworthy.
* Master **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layout.
* Ensure the site is **Responsive** (adapts to mobile screens).
* Use local images to ensure everything loads instantly.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **4 Distinct Pages:** Home, About, Tours, and Booking.
* **Smart Pricing:** I added a feature to show pricing in both INR and Dollars so international tourists aren't confused.
* **Hover Effects:** The cards zoom in slightly when you hover over them, giving the site a premium feel.
* **Fixed Navbar:** The navigation stays at the top as you scroll, just like on major travel sites.

## 💻 Tech Used
* HTML5
* CSS3 (No frameworks, just pure CSS!)
* FontAwesome Icons

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Project
It's a static site, so it's super easy to run. Just download the files and double-click `index.html`.
